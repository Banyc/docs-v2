If you belong to more than one {{< cloud-name >}} organization with the same email address, you can switch from one organization to another while staying logged in. An account can contain multiple organizations. 

To switch {{< cloud-name "short" >}} organizations:

1. In the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} UI, click the organization name dropdown in the upper left and select **Settings**.
2. Click **Switch Organization**. If this option doesn't appear, your email address is only associated with one organization.
3. Select the organization you want to switch to.
