title: Flux and S2 Geometry
description: >
  Our mini-series on geo-temporal data continues with a dive into S2 geometry. Here, Nathanial Cook describes what S2 geometry is, how it accelerates geo-spatial data processing, and how to use S2 cell data in InfluxDB. Part 1 is here - Basics of Geo temporal data and InfluxDB https://youtu.be/OlT1-kMNdCs Part 3 is here - Using Flux to query geo-temporal data https://youtu.be/iT_qKqDWm98
